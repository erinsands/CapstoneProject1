<h1>More About Me</h1>

<p>I grew up in a small town in southwestern Pennsylvania.  We were always outside as a family.  I started skiing at a young age and that never stopped.  From there, my love for the outdoors has only grown stronger.</p>

<p>I moved to Utah in 2015.  I'm still blown away every time I look at the mountains that surround me.  I have been able to explore most of the surrounding area with lots of hiking, camping, skiing, and climbing.  This year, I started mountain and gravel biking.  I recently completed the longest bike ride I have ever done just under 50 miles total.  My goal with biking is to complete a bike packing trip.</p>

<p>Fun fact about me is that I have three cats; Aspen, Gracie, and Sidney.  Aspen and Gracie are siblings and were adopted by my mother and I, and Sidney was adopted when I moved to Utah.  Aspen is a tan Himalyan mix and Gracie is also a Himalayan mix with Himalayan features.  Sidney is a calico.  They each have their own personalities and there's truly never a dull moment.</p>

<p>I also live with my friends who have two Golden Retrievers.  Beans is 4 years old and Ginger is 2 years old.  Also, never a dull moment with unlimited belly rubs, catching the frisbee in the park, and playing tug.</p>

<p>I am searching to continuously challenge myself in my professional career.  I have always been interested in the development side of the information technology field.  I am beyond excited for this new adventure and can't wait to see where it takes me.</p>
